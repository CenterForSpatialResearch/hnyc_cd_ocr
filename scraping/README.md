<b> What is this? </b>

<b> Files in this directory: </b> <br> 
- source: contains input json files corresponding to the digitized City Directories from NYPL
- output: contains output files produced by the Javascript program. Content of the output file include year-wise download links of the TIF files of the corresponding city directory records
- program_wget: contains JavaScript code that produces output links in the structured format, from the input.
