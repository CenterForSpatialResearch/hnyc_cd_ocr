# HNYC City Directory OCR Process using Tesseract v5 
> From image preprocessing to generating corresponding text files to each scanned city directory image from Manhattan and Brooklyn 

This work encompasses the use of Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process over historical City Directories (CD) from Manhattan and Brooklyn. 


### Initial Requirements

This project requires the links to Manhattan CD's scraped from the NYPL website's API, and also the individual pages from Brooklyn CD PDFs.

## How to get this project work on your system


```shell
git clone https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/hnyc_cd_ocr/
cd hnyc_cd_ocr/
npm install -g nypl-spacetime/hocr-detect-columns
```

To succesfully have this project work in your system, you would require the procedure (third command above) to detecting columns (and wrapping lines) work in the system. For the process of detecting columns and wrapping lines into valid entries, we have borrowed the process built and graciously open sources by New York Public Library. More details regarding it ![here](http://spacetime.nypl.org/city-directory-meetup/#/), and code ![here](https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/hocr-detect-columns)



## How the process works

* To ensure no errors come up due to issues with the link, the program first checks that the link is valid and if so proceeds to access the image, using try except block over urllib command
* Cropping the image: This is an essential step that narrows down the image to what is necessary input. With lesser noisy input, Tesseract gives cleaner output. The process involves finding the 4 locations in the image that form the corners of the cropped image. (calculated as a percentage of current image size + pixel indexing starts from top left corner with (0,0)). Used PILLOW libraryâ€™s image.crop command: image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))
* Correcting the orientation (rotating): Depending on the side the page appears in the book (right/left side page), the orientation had to be corrected. This might primarily be because of the cameras that were set up in place for either side of the CD book while capturing the pages. The orientation was same for all pages on a particular side of each book. (usually either 90 or 270). Command used: image.transpose(Image.ROTATE_90).
* Binary thresholding of the image: After having tried both global thresholding and ![local thresholding](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_niblack_sauvola.html#:~:text=Niblack%20and%20Sauvola%20thresholds%20are,for%20text%20recognition%201%2C%202.&text=Here%2C%20we%20binarize%20an%20image,a%20common%20global%20thresholding%20technique.) (particularly the Sauvola Thresholding), local thresholding seemed to give better results. It is said to work better for historical documents because of issues such as ink leakage, erosion, etc.
